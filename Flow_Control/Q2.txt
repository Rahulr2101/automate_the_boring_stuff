1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

Ans: The two values of Boolean data type are true and false. The starting letter of boolean values should be capital like True,False.

2. What are the three Boolean operators?

Ans:  The three Boolean operators are
        1. ==
        2. <
        3. >
    '==' operator is used to evaluate the values on both sides are same or not. If both values are same then condition will be true if not then false

    '<' and '>' are both comparsiom operator.

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

Ans:            | Boolean operator | Values |
                |------------------|--------|
                | True == True     | True   |
                | False == False   | True   |
                | True == False    | False  |
                | True > False     | True   |
                | False > True     | False  |
                | True != False    | True   |
                | False != False   | False  |
                | True != True     | False  |
                | True or False    | True   |
                | False or False   | True   |
                | True or True     | True   |
                | True and False   | False  |
                | False and False  | False  |
                | True and True    | True   |

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
    not (5 > 4)
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
    not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
    (True and True) and (True == False)
    (not False) or (not True)

Ans:   (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)  = False
       not (5 > 4) = False
       (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) = True
       not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) = False
      (True and True) and (True == False) = False
      (not False) or (not True) = True

5. What are the six comparison operators?

Ans:  The six comparison operator are :
            1. <
            2. ==
            3. >
            4 !=
            5. and
            6. or

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

Ans:  Equal to operator is to comparison like it will compare two value if the both value are equal when it will be True else it will be False.
      assignment operator is used to assign values to a variable.

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

Ans:  Condition is statement which evaluate actions in the program and evalutes if it true or false.
        .It should be used where we want a specific code to be run when some condition is met.

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

Ans:  CTRL + C can be use to stop a program

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

Ans: Break is used in loop its actual use is to stop a program. Continue is also used in loop its use is When the program reaches to continues statement it will skip the code written below it.

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

Ans: Range(10) will count number from 0 to 9  and same range(0,10) will also do.
    range(0,10,1) will count in a parttern of 1. eg 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans:  We can call the function by using "spam.bacon()"
